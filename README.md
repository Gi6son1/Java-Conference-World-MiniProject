# Java-Conference-World-Project

This was a java project given to us in university! The aim of the project was to create a conference management system, where you can load conference data from files, add new conferences, speakers etc.

While GitHub's automated programming language analyser for the project specifies 'HTML', this is simply because there are javadoc html files in the repo as well as the java class files.
